## Overview

This transcript documents the execution results of all validation gates in the Foundry build pipeline. Gates are organized into four progressive phases that verify specification compliance, implementation readiness, and system integration.

## Phase Organization

- **Phase 0**: Preflight - Verify dependencies and environment
- **Phase 1**: Specification Integrity - Validate agent outputs
- **Phase 2**: Implementation Readiness - Check build readiness
- **Phase 3**: Integration Verification - Verify cross-system alignment
